# Particle_Detector
Portable cloud chamber with AI captures images of high-energy particle tracks like muons, positrons, neutrons, and electrons. AI classifies and stores data for scientific analysis.

- Develop a portable, automated cloud chamber to visualize and analyze high-energy particle tracks such as muons, positrons, neutrons, and electrons. 
- The system will continuously capture images of the particle tracks within the cloud chamber and use artificial intelligence to classify and analyze these tracks, 
  storing the data for further scientific research.
